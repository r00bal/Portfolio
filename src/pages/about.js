          Hi. My name is Peter. I am passionate about programming and everything that is interactive. I love to code and
          build things on the internet. Currently, I work as an HTML email developer but sharpening my skills in both
          frontend and backend technologies after hours to become a full-stack web developer one day. I am learning
          through web resources and by building my apps that samples you can find in the Projects tab. Among other
          things, I enjoy funk music and surfing. I am a big fan of cooking that is obsessed to drive his pizza cake
          recipe to perfection.
