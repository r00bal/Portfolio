desc: Netflix clone. Well, maybe I shouldn't go that far... This project tries to replicate the first pages of Netflix. It has been built in ReactJS, using Firebase for authentication (sign up, log in, log out), Styled Components for all styling and Fuse.js for live search. Also, it includes testing for all components using React Testing Library.
