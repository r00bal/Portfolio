title: Reddit Clone
desc: This is a full-stack project that uses front-end and back-end technologies. The design follows the Reddit service. It is built with the help of a tutorial by Ben Awad. It provides basic CRUD operations on the server-side like creating an account, creating, deleting, and editing posts, user authentication, cookies session authentication, server-side form validation, etc. I learned a ton when building this project, and I am still expanding it to get as much as possible from it.
tech: React/Next.js, TypeScript, GraphQL, Node.js, PostgreSQL, TypeORM, Redis, TypeGraphQL, Chakra
