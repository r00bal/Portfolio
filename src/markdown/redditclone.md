title: "Reddit Clone"
desc: "This is a full-stack project that uses frontend and backend technologies. The design follows the Reddit service. It is built with the help of the Ben Awad tutorial. It provides basic CRUD operations on the server-side - creating an account, creating, deleting, and editing the posts, user authentication, cookies session authentication, server-side form validation.  I learned a ton when building this project, and I am still expanding it to get as much as possible from it. Tech used here: - React, TypeScript, GraphQL, URQL/Apollo, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MikroORM/TypeORM, Redis, Next.js, TypeGraphQL, Chakra."
