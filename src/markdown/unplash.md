title: Unplash Clone
desc: The Unsplash clone is a searching photos application. I was trying to recreate a beautiful minimalist Unsplash service design together with its basic functionality. I built some cool features from scratch, for example, an autocomplete searching component that shows query suggestions when the user starts typing. You can control the element by keyboard and by mouse, which makes it fully accessible. Other exciting patterns implemented here are - endless images scrolling, lazy loading images, modals, and focus trap. Check the live version and let me know your thoughts *The heart of the app is a free version of Unsplash API with some request limitations of 50 per hour. Please keep in mind when playing with endless scrolling, as you may reach out the limit.
