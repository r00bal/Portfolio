title: Unsplash Clone
desc: The Unsplash clone is an app for browsing photos. I was trying to recreate a beautiful minimalist Unsplash service design together with its basic functionality. I built some cool features from scratch; for example, an autocomplete searching component that shows query suggestions when the user starts typing. You can control the component by keyboard and by mouse, which makes it fully accessible. Other exciting patterns implemented here are - endless images scrolling, lazy loading images, modals, and a focus trap. Feel free to check the live version and let me know your thoughts.
