desc: "This is a restaurant page template. Made in React GatsbyJS and Data CMS. I treat it as my ‘styled-component’ and ‘react spring’ playground. I mixed here a bit of BEM into CSS-in-JS. I was trying to achieve a gentle scrolling parallax effect connected with smooth animations. I was struggling with making the menu button and navigation panel accessible by adding a keyboard control but at the end I think it worked out pretty well. View the site and let me know what you think—technologies used in this project: Gatsby, GraphQL, styled-components, react-spring, BEM modifiers."
