title: Street Food Wok
desc: This is a restaurant page template created in React GatsbyJS and HeadlessCMS for content management. While working on the template, I used the Styled Components and React Spring for the animations. There was also a bit of BEM mixed into CSS-in-JS for a better styling control. I was trying to achieve a gentle scrolling parallax effect connected with smooth animations, and I am proud of the navigation icons which I built myself. The page has a fully accessible navigation panel that can by controlled both by mouse and keyboard.
