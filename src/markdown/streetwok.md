title: Street Food Wok
desc: This is a restaurant page template. Made in React GatsbyJS and HeadlessCMS for content menagment. I used here ‘styled-component’ and ‘react spring’ for the animations. There is also bit of BEM mixed into CSS-in-JS for better styling control. I was trying to achieve a gentle scrolling parallax effect connected with smooth animations. I am proud of the navigation icons which I built myself. The page has fully accessible navigation panel that can by controlled both by mouse or keyboard.   
tech: React/Gatsby.js, GraphQL, Styled components, React Spring
