title: "Sick Fits"
desc: This is a full-stack online shop application built during the Wes Bos' Fullstack Advanced React & GraphQL course. This project uses GraphQL API with Node.js on the back-end and React.js and Apollo on the front-end. It includes many server-side bits, including JWT authentication, permissions, sending an email, uploading images, Pagination, and charging credit cards. Also, complex Relational Data queries and server-side mutations like signing up or checking out and testing React Components. The next TODO for this app is to switch to the new Prisma schema, change render props into hooks wherever possible, and develop a user account section.
tech: React/Next.js, Styled components, React-Apollo, Jest&Enzyme, GraphQL Yoga, Prisma, Stripe
